                        <p className="paragraph">Peacecoin has a ZERO TOLERANCE ANTI-SPAM policy. Any account found to be using Peacecoin for spam will be suspended without 
                        notice. If you know of or suspect any violators, please notify us immediately at <a href="">support@peacecoin.com</a>. Peacecoin Inc. and Peacecoin Jewelry Inc. is

                        <h4>9.2 -What is Spam?</h4>
                        <p className="paragraph">Spam is any type of unsolicited commercial electronic message. By sending messages to only those who have explicitly requested 
                        to receive it, you are following accepted permission-based messaging guidelines. You should not assume a pre-existing relationship to be a substitute for 
                        explicit consent to send messages. For example, if your Customer disclosed a mobile number in a normal course of business but did not specifically express
                        consent to receive your message, you cannot send messages to the number. If it is discovered that you have been delivering any type of message to 
                        recipients (Customer) who have not granted you consent, you will be held fully accountable for your actions. You are subject to any legal actions that 
                        result from such violations including class name action suits whether you use our standard user interface or API. Please refer to the following list of 
                        resources to help combat possible spam violations:</p>
