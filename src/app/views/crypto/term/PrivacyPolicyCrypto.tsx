                                    Income Disclosure Statement ("IDS"). The Peacecoin IDS is designed
                                    to convey truthful, timely, and comprehensive information regarding the income
                                    that Peacecoin Affiliates earn. In order to accomplish this objective, a copy
                                    of the IDS must be presented to all prospective Affiliates. The terms "income
                                    claim" and/or "earnings representation" (collectively "income claim") include:
                                    (1) statements of average earnings, (2) statements of non-average earnings, (3)
                                    statements of earnings ranges, (4) income testimonials, (5) lifestyle
                                    claims and (6) hypothetical claims. In any meeting that is open to the public in
                                    which the Compensation Plan is discussed, or any type of income
                                    claim is made, you must provide every prospective Affiliate with the information
                                    in the IDS.IDS: The Peacecoin Compensation Plan is an exciting
                                    opportunity that rewards all member participants for the sale of the Peacecoin
                                    Silver Coins and Peacecoin Jewelry Line locally and globally. These member
                                    participants canalso bring other Affiliates and Customers to the Peacecoin’s
                                    Platform and create a substantial passive income. Although the
                                    opportunity is nearly unlimited, individual results will vary depending on
                                    commitment levels and sales skills of each participant. Peacecoin
                                    Guarantees NO income claims NOR does it indorse in-any-way or shape any income
                                    claims by its member participants other than their actual earnings.
                                    Since Peacecoin has been in operation for less than a year, there are no IDS
                                    numbers but based on industry standards and company projections,
                                    the average annual gross income for participants from the compensation plan is
                                    projected to be anywhere between $500 and $2,000. There will certainly be
                                    participants who will earn less while others could earn much more. We’re excited
                                    about the Peacecoin unique platform and compensation Plan. We are confident
                                    it will provide a solid foundation to help achieve one’s financial goals while
                                    helping others do the same. If income projections were presented
                                    to you prior to your enrollment, such projections are not necessarily
                                    representative of the income, if any, that you can or will earn through your

                                    should not be considered as guarantees or projections of your actual earnings

                                    leadership. Furthermore, should the time come that any
                                    regulatory organization to legally inquire about the income statement of any
                                    participant’s earnings, Peacecoin will comply and disclose that
                                    information. When available the information from the IDS must be presented to a

                                    discussed, or any type of income claim, or earnings representation is made.

                                <p>Although a Peacecoin business is a privately owned, independently operated

                                    certain limitations. If an Affiliate wishes to sell their Peacecoin business,
                                    the following criteria must be met:

                                        <li>If the buyer is an active Peacecoin Affiliate, they must first terminate

                                <p>Spam is any type of unsolicited commercial electronic messages. By sending
                                    messages to only those who have explicitly requested to receive it,
                                    you are following accepted permission-based messaging guidelines. You should not
                                    assume a preexisting relationship to be a substitute for
                                    explicit consent to send messages. For example, if your Customer disclosed a
                                    mobile number in a normal course of business but did not specifically
                                    express consent to receive your message, you cannot send messages to the number.
                                    If it is discovered that you have been delivering any type of message to
                                    recipients who have not granted you consent, you will be held fully accountable
                                    for your actions. You are subject to any legal actions that result
                                    from such violations including class action suits whether you use our standard

                                <h3>If there is a penalty, what is it? What will they leave with?</h3>
                                <p>Just like any company out there that is legitimate yes you can cancel and opt
                                    out. There are no penalties. Just like any customer who makes a purchase
                                    you can cancel and opt out. This is called the refund policy. So here is what
                                    happens. Because you are using a credit card to come in,
                                    there are restrictions and protocols. 1. You have to wait for a grace period.
                                    This can be between 14-30 days after you formally cancel to realize
                                    a full refund. 2. You must RETURN the product back to the company. A. The Silver
                                    Coins you will be receiving or have received. & B.
                                    The 1,000 crypto coins you were gifted from the company. The reason you were
                                    gifted these crypto coins was because of the goodness of the company
                                    the owners and founders. Also because they are "grateful" that you are part of
                                    the "Peace Movement". So if you cancel and opt you are required and it's
                                    your obligation to return the cryptocurrancy the company has sent to you on the
                                    Blockchain. If the customer does not return these, then there may be no
                                    refund. When a customer is ready to refund he/she will have to send their coins
                                    back to the Peacecoin Inc. At that point the member will receive a 100%
                                    no questions asked refund. This process can take 14-30 days. The customer and
                                    the member is required to submit a ticket from their back office asking
                                    for a refund and cancelation. Then the process begins. Once approved immediately
                                    customer cannot revert. Then there is a cooling off period of 1 year
                                    or 365 day calendar days after they submit their support ticket for request for
                                    opting out or cancelation.</p>
